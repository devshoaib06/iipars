    <strong>Importance of Research and Journal Publications in Higher Studies</strong>
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>In the rat race to emerge as a rank holder in the class, the essence of student life has lost its charm. At the end of a semester, what the world awaits for is the report cards and the marks imprinted over them. Quite adjusted and groomed to entertain such a mindset, students these days are mugging up the lessons rather than going in-depth into the topic. They are no longer interested in going any further beyond the academic syllabus. This mindset continues in higher studies as well, as students feel more compelled to land in a job right after the completion of graduation. Very few of them acknowledge the importance of research publications in academic careers. Nowadays, only a handful of students are interested in pursuing their career in research as it demands dedication and effort.</p><br>

    <p>
    <strong>Benefits of Publishing a Research Paper</strong>
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>There is great relevance to research in education. Apart from ensuring an in-depth knowledge over a topic, scientific and historical research papers also contribute to the world of knowledge. These journals or papers become the helping hands for the students in future guiding and helping them in research. Students need to understand the role of scientific research in society and the importance of scientific research in education as it will ultimately reward them in return.<br>
Some of the key points that highlight the importance of publishing research papers in UG / PG are mentioned below:
</p>
<br>
<p>
  1.  <strong>Enhancement of Teaching Practices:</strong> Teaching methodologies will certainly develop if the teachers tend to do more research and analysis over the topic. This is referred to as research- oriented teaching, where the educators are engaged in acquiring knowledge and information outside the textbook, to get modern and innovative information over a subject for the students.<br><br>

2.  <strong>Students Tend to Learn Effectively:</strong> Students tend to learn more proficiently when they learn through research activities. Research-based learning supports the genuine interest of a student while learning about a particular topic. Guided by seniors and professors, students get clarity of concept about a particular subject.<br><br>

3.  <strong>Encouragement of Research-Based Practice and Knowledge Production:</strong> Promoting motivation and encouragement among the students to advance further regarding the topic and publish their own journals, implementation of research activities in studies can be of high
significance. The educational institutes must understand the significance of research and design their curriculum accordingly by assigning some professors to work solely for research and journal publications.<br><br>

4.  <strong>A Chance of Getting Admission into Top Colleges:</strong> Most of the universities will offer admission to the students if their research paper gets published in reputed scientific journals. The students, who have proficient research papers available in their names, possess a maximum chance to get a scholarship to study in the top universities of the world. Apart from that, students can also apply to different courses and scholarships worldwide seeking admission based on their research works.<br><br>

5.  <strong>Helps in Building a Professional Career:</strong> Considered as one of the requirements for Master’s and Doctorate students, journal paper adds the glory in the professional careers of the students. With more acquired knowledge through research methodologies, a person can share knowledge with the world by teaching or assisting fellow students in research activities and journal publications.

</p><br><br>

<p>
  <h2>A. No of Papers Required:</h2>
</p><br>

<p>* For would be professors:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least 6 papers<br><br>
* For existing professors:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&nbspAt least 6 papers (1+3+2)<br><br>
* For PTT/GT/SACT:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&nbspAt least 4 papers<br><br>
</p><br>

<p>
  <h2>B. Category of Journal:</h2>
</p><br>

<p><strong>1. UGC-CARE (Category-I)</strong><br>
The University Grant Commission has established “Consortium for Academic and Research Ethics” (CARE) for creation and maintenance of “Reference List of Quality Journals”. CARE members include Statutory Councils/Academies/ Government bodies and others like the Association of Indian Universities.
</p><br><br>


<p><strong>2. UGC-CARE (Category-II): Elsevier's abstract and citation database</strong><br>
Scopus is Elsevier's abstract and citation database launched in 2004. All journals covered in the Scopus database, regardless of who they are published under, are reviewed each year to ensure high quality standards are maintained. Searches in Scopus also incorporate searches of patent databases.
</p><br><br>

<p><strong>3. UGC-CARE (Category-II): Web of Science</strong><br>
Web of Science (WOS) was the only international and multidisciplinary database until 2004. Elsevier introduced Scopus in 2004 as a good replacement for WOS. These two databases to index prestigious journals have been compared from different aspects.
</p><br><br>

<p><strong>4. UGC Approved journal</strong><br>
The UGC approved List of Journals contain 38,653 journals that are indexed in Web of Science, Scopus and Indian Citation Index. Besides, journals covered in a selected indexing and abstracting services are also being added to the UGC Approved List of Journals.</p><br><br>
 


<p><strong>5. Peer-reviewed Journal</strong><br>
Peer-reviewed (refereed or scholarly) journals - Articles are written by experts and are reviewed by several other experts in the field before the article is published in the journal in order to ensure the article's quality. (The article is more likely to be scientifically valid, reach reasonable conclusions, etc.)<br><br>
Scopus indexing journal is much desirable than other categories, but due to some factors like (publication needs much time / it maintains very high standard / it is expensive for publication) – we often opt for CARE listed / approved journal.

   <p>
    <strong>Dissertation</strong> can be nyctophobia and among the most overwhelming tasks in academic career. It’s a time consuming process to prepare and plan to write a good dissertation. Most unfortunate thing is that due to lac of time inspite of having great potentiality most of the people are unable to do it. Dissertation should be a reflection of academic goals. Many people get confused with their dissertation project because of all the rules and formats and need assistance. We very often forget that Dissertation is a major part of degree work and its counts almost 60 credits. 
    </p>
    <p>The components of <strong>Dissertation</strong>  are research methodology and training both qualitative and quantitative, statistics, applied research methods, basic computing and scientific communications, management principles, social; ethics, writing reviews, presentations and seminars including preparation for Viva Voce, review of literature, referencing style, formulation of research questions, questionnaire development and other areas relevant to research.<br>
It is difficult to give a structure that should be followed universally. However, most dissertations should have a structure similar to the following.
</p>
    <br>
    <br>

   <p> <strong>Dissertation Structure:</strong><br><br></p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This is usually 200-250 words and describes the subject of the research, the methodology employed and the main findings and recommendation.</p><br>

<p><strong>Introduction:</strong>  A rationale and justification for the need for the study. A broad statement of the purpose of the study and its aims and objectives. The research problem, specifics and justification of these objectives should be included in this section.</p><br>

<p><strong>Literature Review:</strong>  The literature review considers the work of theorists in the area and compares their work with others. The section should not merely be descriptive, but rather should compare and contrast various perspectives on the matter. All relevant and recent work on the topic should be reviewed. In essence the literature review is a thorough and selective appraisal of the topic. It should discuss the key theories and concepts related to the research aims and objectives.</p><br>

<p><strong>Methodology:</strong> This section is used to provide details of the design of the research. There is normally a reiteration of the objectives. It should include a rationale for the choice of research design/approach, the procedure used, details of the empirical work and the method of analysis.</p><br>

<p><strong>Findings:</strong> Analysis of results/data.</p><br>

<p><strong>Discussion:</strong> This section is probably the most important section of the dissertation and the findings of the work should be discussed in detail in relation to the original issues/problem. An interpretation of the findings and a discussion of their practical and theoretical implications should be included.</p><br>

<p><strong>Conclusions & Recommendations:</strong> The work should be concluded by identifying and highlighting the key findings and by suggesting some areas for improvement and/or further work depending on the topic.</p><br>

<p><strong>Appendices:</strong> Material which is relevant to the work, but which is too long, detailed or in some form that would interrupt the flow of the work is inserted in the appendices. Examples of such material would be the questionnaires and computer programmes.</p><br>

<p><strong>References:</strong> The reference section must include all the references that are cited in the dissertation, these should be presented using the Harvard/APA system (please see point 6 on page eight for further details).</p><br>

<p><strong>Bibliography:</strong> A list (Harvard/APA system) of the books and articles consulted within the dissertation but not cited in your text.</p><br>
