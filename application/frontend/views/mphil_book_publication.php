    You cannot write a half-baked biography at 30 but can surely write a book. We all have wished to write a book at some point of time of our life that would showcase all the colours of our emotions. IIPARS hereby presenting you the opportunity to blend your education with emotion and putting that on pen and paper by turning your project into a full-fledged book. Mostly Post Graduate and B.Ed. students tends to put in half-hearted effort for projects and assignments with the common intent of it as an academic trajectory that has no other implication other than an assessment to be presented. IIPARS helps a student to paint the canvas of efforts put into a research paper.

    <br><br>
    <p>Just like our thesis to book service, we are converging students’ project work into international standard book. Generally, a preconceived notion has already been existing among the students that these projects do not serve a higher heuristic purpose and thus a well cottoned situation has been eventually existing in which post graduate students are not invested as expected into their projects. IIPARS enjoins this with the motto of actualizing the bona fide intention of the task of projects at the first place. Thus, our institute provides students an opportunity to project themselves before the world through converting it into an international standard book. This way we value both the effort put in by a student in making a project and also giving the recognition it deserves.</p><br>
