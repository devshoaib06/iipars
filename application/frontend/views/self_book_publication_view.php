   Generally, motto for obtaining PG courses is directly linked to the aspiration of becoming a professor. Thus, going for Ph.D. degree serves three purposes (i) to get a professorship in college and university level (ii) promotions after employment (iii) financial incentives. Caged into this three-dimensional stereotypical approach, most aspirants do not even find the exposure to explore other alternatives that are more or equally lucrative. Though during education, one is taught to think big but due to peer pressure and sublimity of corresponding careers one’s mind eventually gets limited. If the thesis paper can be converted to an international standard book on international platforms backed by an enduring marketing bash then the researcher is made capable of name, fame, reputation alongside constant revenue generation. Understanding the basic instinct of human nature, IIPARS makes way for an academician to create an identity of his own that too on an international scale. Valuing your effort put into a thesis making, we with our innovative package of converting thesis to an international standard book can reinstate your thesis from a domestic library to an international forum where thousands of students would facilitate their growth and research depending on your shown path. We are old school believers where we believe knowledge gets multiplied only when it is shared. Just as the brave saint once said, imparting education is the biggest charity ever. We are here to help you share your knowledge out with the world.

  <h2>Dissertation or Project Work to Book Conversion and Publication:</h2>
  
   <p>
    You cannot write a half-baked biography at 30 but can surely write a book. We all have wished to write a book at some point of time of our life that would showcase all the colours of our emotions. IIPARS hereby presenting you the opportunity to blend your education with emotion and putting that on pen and paper by turning your project into a full-fledged book. Mostly Post Graduate and B.Ed. students tends to put in half-hearted effort for projects and assignments with the common intent of it as an academic trajectory that has no other implication other than an assessment to be presented. IIPARS helps a student to paint the canvas of efforts put into a research paper.

    <br><br>
    <p>Just like our thesis to book service, we are converging students’ project work into international standard book. Generally, a preconceived notion has already been existing among the students that these projects do not serve a higher heuristic purpose and thus a well cottoned situation has been eventually existing in which post graduate students are not invested as expected into their projects. IIPARS enjoins this with the motto of actualizing the bona fide intention of the task of projects at the first place. Thus, our institute provides students an opportunity to project themselves before the world through converting it into an international standard book. This way we value both the effort put in by a student in making a project and also giving the recognition it deserves.</p><br>
