   Generally, motto for obtaining PG courses is directly linked to the aspiration of becoming a professor. Thus, going for Ph.D. degree serves three purposes (i) to get a professorship in college and university level (ii) promotions after employment (iii) financial incentives. Caged into this three-dimensional stereotypical approach, most aspirants do not even find the exposure to explore other alternatives that are more or equally lucrative. Though during education, one is taught to think big but due to peer pressure and sublimity of corresponding careers oneâ€™s mind eventually gets limited. If the thesis paper can be converted to an international standard book on international platforms backed by an enduring marketing bash then the researcher is made capable of name, fame, reputation alongside constant revenue generation.
