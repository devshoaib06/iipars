Here are the few things that can help you to crack the UGC NET exam in the first attempt. So, here we go.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. Since there are only two papers-General Paper 1 and Paper 2 in NTA-UGC NET instead of three papers as earlier in the CBSE UGC NET exam, allocate at least one month for each of the two papers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. Do not believe in any short cuts. You have to remain focused and work hard to learn all the topics of your paper 1 and the subject that you have chosen for your paper 2.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. Prepare a timetable and stick to it so that you do not end up devoting more time to any particular unit. Unless you follow a timetable, you will not have ample time to cover the vast syllabus, and this could shatter your dreams of cracking one of the toughest exams.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. Get the best reference books or study material for both Paper 1 and Paper 2. Make sure that they cover the updated syllabus of UGC NET. Remember that the syllabus was revised by NTA in June 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5. Try to get previous year question papers for both paper 1 and paper 2 to understand the difficulty level and the type of questions that you have to attempt from each unit of your subject.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>6. Have time in your hand to practice online mock tests for self-assessment. On the NTA website, you can practice <strong><a href=\"https://teachinns.com\">online mock tests</a></strong>. Select UGC-NET and your subject for Paper 2 from the drop-down menu of the form to start.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>7. Lastly, don&rsquo;t believe in having just an overview of the prepared notes or study materials to crack the exam. You must acquire a thorough knowledge of all the concepts of the topics of both the papers. So, revise again and again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To ensure quick revisions, prepare short notes covering all the vital points of each of the topics included in the exam syllabus.

While most people give focus on preparing for Paper-II (200 marks), your dreams of cracking the NTA NET/SET/JRF exam could doom if you neglect your preparation for the Paper I.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The paper features 50 questions that are designed to test your teaching and research aptitude, reading comprehension skills, data interpretation skills, and more. Since the syllabus is vast, it is essential to develop a plan of study to understand and cover all the topics in minimal time to get more time for revision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, let&rsquo;s know the five easy steps to qualify the General Paper I exam in the very first attempt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Step 1-Start with the Teaching Aptitude&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Start with the teaching aptitude topic. It is relatively tough than the rest. Teaching aptitude is all about your natural ability to teach, but the questions that are regularly asked from this topic are not easy for most of the students. If you are weak in mathematics, you can also start with reasoning because it includes mathematics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Step 2-Assign Deadlines for Each Topic </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Assign realistic deadlines for each topic after carefully analyzing the number of sub-topics. Remember, some may take a longer time to cover. Unless you assign deadlines, you will end up spending more hours on some topics which can adversely affect your exam preparation. Also, try to give several mock tests for this general paper to evaluate your knowledge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Step 3-Take Adequate Breaks </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes, it happens that despite studying for hours, you discover that you failed miserably to absorb the concepts. It happens because even our brain has its limits. So, take breaks of 15-20 minutes after studying for one to two hours. This will not only increase your power of information retention but will also relax your mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Take a study break properly. Refrain from checking your social media accounts during the break. It may lead to a longer break than you have desired. After all, social media is addictive! So, instead of saving your break time for checking your social media accounts, go for an outdoor walk. Utilizing the time for decluttering your home or chatting with a friend are some of the few effective ways of taking a proper break while studying for UGC NET General Paper I.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Step 4-Prepare Quick &amp; Short Notes&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Get into the habit of preparing notes that cover all the vital points of each topic of General Paper I so that it becomes easier to revise each time. Make it color-coded as it will help you to grasp information quickly. You can also take the help of online platforms that offer easy to refer General Paper I study material to save your precious time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Step 5-Practice, Practice &amp; Practice </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Irrespective of the hours you dedicate to prepare for the UGC NET exam, especially to General Paper I, it is vital to practice as much as you can. There are teachers and instructors to guide you, various online platforms and digital classrooms to give you provide you with study material, but you still need to practice. Keep practicing UGC NET General Paper mock tests. Also, try to solve as many question papers of previous years to get a fair idea of the kind of questions that you will likely encounter during your exam.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do not lose hope if you are not able to grasp the topics during the initial days. It may take some time.

However, if you are a NET aspirant, do not get anxious while thinking about all these. Instead, keep your focus on your goal to crack the coveted exam. Yes, you may be already putting several hours each day to prepare well for the exam, but you must also be familiar with several things about the same.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are the top five things that you must know about the UGC NET exam scheduled to be held in June 2020.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>It is from December 2018 onwards that the National Testing Agency (NTA) is conducting the UGC NET exam across India. Earlier, this was conducted by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE).&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>The upcoming UGC-NET June exam will be a computer-based test (CBT) in which there will be a countdown timer on the computer screen. When the timer reaches zero, the exam will end automatically. You don&rsquo;t have to end the same.&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>To get familiar with the computer-based test, you can visit the NTA website and can opt for an&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https://teachinns.com\" target=\"_blank\">online mock test</a></strong>&nbsp;for practice</li>\r\n	<li>Since heavy frisking is done, it is advisable to reach the exam center well before the scheduled time.

I\'m a freelance web developer who can provide your site with a stunning and functional web user-interface. Websites I\'ve built in the past aren\'t just stunning, but they also integrate with my clients\' business processes and make it easier for them to run their companies and easier to get new clients. \r\n\r\nNewer websites have the ability to do just about anything you can imagine and there are usually pre-built modules for any additional things you want to incorporate. Just like Apps in the App Store on your phone (\"There\'s an App for that\"). I work with most of the major programming languages, website platforms, shopping carts, etc. and I specialize in one platform that\'s truly amazing called WordPress. Building your site on that platform gives you an incredible number of features which allows you to personally make changes to your site in a simple and easy manner. \r\n\r\nI do all the work by myself, and I never outsource. I\'d love to hear some of your ideas for the site and provide you with a few of my own as well. Would you be interested in hearing more? Kindly write back to let me know if you\'re interested and we can take it from there.

I\'m an expert with the WordPress website platform, and I\'m also skilled with many other platforms and shopping carts as well. If you\'d like, I can show you some of my previous work to give you a better idea of what I am capable of accomplishing for the benefit of your business. \r\n\r\nIf you already have some design ideas in mind, I\'d like to know them and help you implement all of it to the site. I\'ve also got some ideas (of which I\'d love for you to hear) that will make use of what existing elements you have on your site and make it even better. I could also build you a completely new site with all the modern features that your business will need if that\'s what you prefer.\r\n\r\nI\'ll provide you with a free consultation over the phone in the next few days if you are interested.

I\'m a freelance web designer who can help you integrate smart features that a business website should have, as well as a modern look and feel. I\'m sending you this message because I\'d like to help you out with your website\'s design. I\'m able to work with most of the major programming languages, website platforms, and shopping carts, and I specialize in one platform that\'s truly amazing called WordPress. Designing your site on a platform gives you an incredible number of features and allows you to personally make changes to your site in a really easy manner. \r\n\r\nI do all the work by myself freelance and I never outsource. I\'d also like to hear your ideas for the website design and provide you with a few of my own as well. Kindly write back to let me know if this is something you\'d like to know more about and we\'ll take it from there.

Oil exports to the United States, Japan, and Western Europe, which together consumed more than half the world&rsquo;s energy, were also prohibited. OPEC&rsquo;s decision was made in retaliation for Western support of Israel against Egypt and Syria during the&nbsp;Yom Kippur War&nbsp;(1973) and in response to a persistent decline in the value of the U.S. dollar (the denominated currency for oil sales), which had eroded the export earnings of OPEC states. With the global capitalist economy already experiencing difficulties, these actions precipitated a steep recession accompanied by rising inflation. This forced capitalist countries to embark on a process of economic restructuring in order to reduce their dependency on oil and prompted fears that the United States might take military action in order to secure free access to its energy supplies. Although the oil embargo was lifted in 1974, oil prices remained high, and the capitalist world economy continued to stagnate throughout the 1970s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another major oil crisis occurred in 1979, a result of the&nbsp;Iranian Revolution&nbsp;(1978&ndash;79).

One of the paired bottles is covered with black tape or aluminum foil to exclude light and other is kept clear to admit light and allow photosynthesis.

Very common among them are:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>a) Intrapersonal or Goal conflicts b) Interpersonal conflicts,</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong><u>a. Intrapersonal conflicts:</u></strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>These are the conflicts caused within the individual. <strong>This is called multiple approach-avoidance conflicts. These are as follows:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. Approach-approach conflict:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this type of conflict, individuals will have two desires with positive valence which are equally powerful. For example, a person has two attractive job offers and he has to choose any one of the- tension arises.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. Avoidance-avoidance conflict:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This conflict involves two goals with negative valence. At times the individual is forced to choose one among two negative goals. In such conflicts, both are unwanted goals, but he cannot keep quiet without opting also. For example, a woman must work at a job which she dislikes very much or else she has to remain unemployed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. Approach-avoidance conflict:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is also a most complex conflict and very difficult to resolve. Because in this type of conflict a person is both attracted and repelled by the same goal object. Here the goal object will have both positive and negative valences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. Multiple-approach-avoidance conflict:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some of the situations in life we come across will involve both positive and negative valences of multiple nature. Suppose a woman is engaged to be married. The marriage to her has positive valences like-providing security to life and marrying a person whom she loves very much.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>5. Resolution of Conflicts:</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The conflicts may arise from frustrations, competing roles or goals having positive or negative valences. Some conflicts are of great danger to the mental health of the individual. Hence, it is necessary to resolve them as quickly as possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong><u>b. Interpersonal conflicts:</u></strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interpersonal conflict is caused by individuals. This can be resolved through some strategies such as avoiding, smoothing, forcing, confronting, and compromising. Assertive behavior and I am ok, you are ok interpersonal orientation help to resolve such conflicts easily.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>1. Unconscious Conflict:</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The mental conflict below the level of conscious awareness is called unconscious conflict. The conflicts in the conscious level, when repressed, shift to the unconscious. Here the desires which cannot be satisfied at the conscious level are repressed to the unconscious level as a mechanism of escaping. Many of our wants raised by Id may not be socially acceptable. Such wants are objected by the Ego and the Superego. Hence these are repressed to the unconscious.</p>','0',1,'2020-09-09 19:55:57','2020-09-09 19:57:01'),(800,'<p>Match the following two lists in order to render them meaningful in terms of the psychology of growth and development and select the right answer from the given codes.&nbsp;<strong>Codes:&nbsp; (a) (b) &nbsp;(c) &nbsp;(d) </strong></p>',NULL,'2',1,'2020-09-09 19:57:36','2020-09-09 19:57:36'),(801,'<p>In improving classroom teaching-learning interactions, which of the following strategies is linked with the later adolescence stage of development?</p>',NULL,'0',1,'2020-09-09 19:59:13','2020-09-09 19:59:13'),(802,'<p>Who is an arch advocate of trait theory of personality?</p>','<p>In 1936, psychologist&nbsp;Gordon Allport&nbsp;found that one English-language dictionary alone contained more than 4,000 words describing&nbsp;different personality traits</p>','0',1,'2020-09-09 19:59:55','2020-09-09 20:00:30'),(803,'<p>A student is rebuked by his/her class teacher for negligence in studies.

Denial:</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Denial is one of the most common defense mechanisms. It occurs when you refuse to accept reality or facts. You block external events or circumstances from your mind so that you don&rsquo;t have to deal with the emotional impact. In other words, you avoid the painful feelings or events.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>2. Repression:</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Unsavory thoughts, painful memories, or irrational beliefs can upset you. Instead of facing them, you may unconsciously choose to hide them in hopes of forgetting about them entirely.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>3. Projection:</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Some thoughts or feelings you have about another person may make you uncomfortable. If you&nbsp;project those feelings, you&rsquo;re misattributing them to the other person.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, you may dislike your new co-worker, but instead of accepting that, you choose to tell yourself that they dislike you. You see in their actions the things you wish you could do or say.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>4. Displacement:</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>You direct strong emotions and frustrations toward a person or object that doesn&rsquo;t feel threatening. This allows you to satisfy an impulse to react, but you don&rsquo;t risk significant consequences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A good example of this defense mechanism is&nbsp;getting angry at your child&nbsp;or spouse because you had a bad day at work. Neither of these people is the target of your strong emotions, but reacting to them is likely less problematic than reacting to your boss.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>5. Regression:</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Some people who feel threatened or anxious may unconsciously &ldquo;escape&rdquo; to an earlier stage of development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adults can regress, too. Adults who are struggling to cope with events or behaviors may return to sleeping with a cherished stuffed animal, overeat foods they find comforting, or begin chain smoking or chewing on pencils or pens. They may also avoid everyday activities because they feel overwhelming.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>6. Rationalization:</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Some people may attempt to explain undesirable behaviors with their own set of &ldquo;facts.&rdquo; This allows you to feel comfortable with the choice you made, even if you know on another level it&rsquo;s not right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, people who might be angry at co-workers for not completing work on time could be ignoring the fact that they&rsquo;re typically late, too.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>7. Sublimation:</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This type of defense mechanism is considered a&nbsp;positive strategy. That&rsquo;s because people who rely on it choose to redirect strong emotions or feelings into an object or activity that is appropriate and safe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, instead of lashing out at your employees, you choose to channel your frustration into kickboxing or exercise. You could also funnel or redirect the feelings into music, art, or sports.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>8. Reaction formation:</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>People who use this defense mechanism recognize how they feel, but they choose to behave in the opposite manner of their instincts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A person who reacts this way, for example, may feel they should not express negative emotions, such as anger or frustration. They choose to instead react in an overly positive way.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>9. Compartmentalization:</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Separating your life into independent sectors may feel like a way to protect many elements of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, when you choose to not discuss personal life issues at work, you block off, or compartmentalize, that element of your life. This allows you to carry on without facing the anxieties or challenges while you&rsquo;re in that setting or mindset.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>10. Intellectualization:</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>When you&rsquo;re hit with a trying situation, you may choose to remove all emotion from your responses and instead focus on quantitative facts. You may see this strategy in use when a person who is let go from a job choose to spend their days creating spreadsheets of job opportunities and leads.</p>','0',1,'2020-09-09 20:00:56','2020-09-09 20:01:30'),(804,'<p>Which of the following is intimately associated with mental health?</p>','<p>Mental health&nbsp;is the level of&nbsp;psychological&nbsp;well-being&nbsp;or an absence of&nbsp;mental illness.
